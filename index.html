        <p><h3>Hello! My name is Matthew Stangeland, 
            and I'm a senior at Mountain Vista High School. 
            As of right now, May 5th, 2025, I will be done with school in
            just eight days. Crazy to think how these past four years have
            gone by so fast. Anyways, I thought I'd make a final website 
            about me, my passions, and what I plan on doing in the future. 
            <br><br>
            To any future kids who are here looking at this page, just remember
            to take advantage of these years in youth, and not to take things too
            seriously. Seriously. It's a hassle worrying about mundane things.
            <br><br>
            Now, without further ado, go ahead and explore my little portfolio!

            literally exploring the mines.<br><br> I have a LOT of fun with my friends.
