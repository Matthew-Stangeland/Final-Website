        <h3>Apart from my passions and social life, I have done a fairly good job with my academics as well.
             I am in the National Honors Society, and will graduating with Honors. I've participated in community events,
              managing for the Girls' tennis team, working more than 40 community service hours for Senior year. 
              I have a weighted GPA of 4.0, and have been recognized as a top academic mind at MVHS. I'm a good writer, programmer, and above all, a good student (at least that's what I've been told.)

        <h3>I will be attending the University of Colorado Boulder in Fall of 2025
            as a first year, and the new class of 2029. I will be majoring, for right now,
            in Compute Science, but I'll likely change it to something in business, as I believe
            my skills are more centered around the business world. <br><br>This my new journey that I will be 
            doing, and leaving the one at high school behind. It is the end of a thirteen-year era in
            my life, and I can not wait to start anew. <br><br>
            Thank you so much for looking at my little portfolio!
